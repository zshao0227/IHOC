># 2014–2020: Platforms and Ecosystems – The Formation of Internet Giants

---
By 2013, the number of internet users in China had reached 600 million, and the growth of both internet and mobile internet users began to slow significantly. One year later, China became the country with the largest number of internet users in the world, as well as the country with the most mobile internet users. The sheer scale of users triggered a transformative, qualitative shift. During this period, technology advanced rapidly toward greater sophistication, and artificial intelligence gradually became a foundational capability for companies such as ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba. AlphaGo’s decisive victory over the world’s top Go players shocked humanity. The keywords of this era were: artificial intelligence, Internet Plus, and connecting everything.

进入到2013年，中国互联网用户已达到6亿，互联网用户、移动互联网用户增速开始明显放缓。1年后，中国成为全球网民数量最多的国家，同时也是全球移动网民人数最多的国家。绝对多的用户数量，产生绝对质变的化学反应。期间科技也高速的向高精尖发展，人工智能逐渐成为字节跳动、腾讯、阿里巴巴等公司底层基础能力。AlphaGo完胜世界顶级围棋高手，震撼了全人类。这个时期关键词是：人工智能、互联网+、连接一切。

During this period, a new term emerged: “Internet Plus.” The “+” after “Internet” was connected to traditional industries such as telecommunications, media, entertainment, retail, finance, and transportation. This era also gave birth to outstanding companies such as WeChat, Dedao, Douyin, Kuaishou, Xiaohongshu, Ele.me, Ant Financial, and Didi Chuxing.

这期间诞生了新词汇：互联网+。“互联网+”的“+”后连接上了传统的各行各业——通信、媒体、娱乐、零售、金融、出行等领域。期间诞生了微信、得到、抖音、快手、小红书、饿了么、蚂蚁金服、滴滴打车等优秀公司。

The power of venture capital also continued to grow. The fierce capital battle over shared bicycles left a bold mark in history, while also revealing the greed and dark side of capital.

VC的力量也在持续成长，共享单车的资本大战，给历史留下浓墨重彩的一笔，也让人们认识到了资本的贪婪与邪恶。

In 2018, the P2P online lending platform faced another round of massive defaults, causing significant losses for investors. While the 2014 defaults were largely fraudulent projects, the 2018 crisis was primarily caused by financial risks spreading to the P2P platforms due to the broader financial environment.

2018年，P2P网贷平台再度迎来一轮爆雷潮，投资人损失惨重。2014年爆雷的多是诈骗项目，而2018年暴雷潮更多是是整个金融环境引发的风险传递到了网贷平台。

In 2020, the path to international expansion faced obstacles. The domestic internet boom was essentially declared to have peaked. Uncontrollable factors like overseas market policies led to India suddenly banning 59 Chinese apps with one decree, turning the Indian market from a blue ocean into an investment no-go zone. Huawei struggled in the US and European markets, facing the risk of being cut off from supplies. Despite multiple attempts to distance itself from its Chinese parent company, TikTok faced the possibility of being banned and considered selling its operations.

2020年，出海之路受阻。国内互联网红利基本上宣告见顶。海外市场政策等因素不可控，一夜之间印度当局的一纸禁令封禁了59款中国应用，印度，一下子从蓝海变为投资禁区。华为在美国和欧洲市场步履维艰，面临断供风险。TikTok，虽然几度努力撇开跟中国母公司的关系，力证自己立足本地，依然一度面临被封禁而打算“卖身”。
