# The Early 2000s: Awaiting Scale
# 2000 年代初期：等待规模

In the early 2000s, Chinese tech companies, especially Alibaba, lay the foundations for the pervasive urban e-commerce environment that would emerge fifteen years later. They’re waiting for one thing: scale. State control is relatively light and lags innovation, although online monitoring and censorship are already underway.

2000年代初期，中国科技公司，尤其是阿里巴巴，为15年后出现的普遍城市电子商务环境奠定了基础。他们等待的是一件事：规模。国家控制相对较轻，落后于创新，尽管在线监控和审查制度已经在进行中。

March 2000 – Bill Clinton thinks trying to crack down on the internet is like “trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.” But the internet in China develops within the context of a political regime finding mechanisms to ensure continued control—not a government sleepwalking into a digitally driven revolution.

2000 年 3 月 – 比尔·克林顿 （Bill Clinton） 认为试图打击互联网就像“试图将果冻钉在墙上”。但中国的互联网是在一个政治政权寻找确保持续控制的机制的背景下发展的，而不是一个政府梦游到一场数字驱动的革命中。

In November, NASDAQ：GAME's online game *mir2* was launched. This game was introduced by Chen Tianqiao, who secured exclusive distribution rights from the Korean Actoz company for \$300,000. At the time, NASDAQ：GAME's funds were only enough to purchase the *mir2* copyright, with no money left even for renting servers. *mir2* was a role-playing game, where players invested significant time and money, creating strong user engagement. Shengda earned substantial profits. Within a month, the number of simultaneous users of *mir2* quickly surpassed 400,000, and Shengda had recouped all its investment. In 2002, NASDAQ：GAME’s revenue and net profit reached 326 million yuan and 139 million yuan, respectively. In 2003, both revenue and net profit nearly doubled compared to the previous year, reaching 633 million yuan and 273 million yuan, respectively. At this time, NASDAQ：GAME had only about 100 employees, but *mir2* was generating over 1 million yuan in daily revenue. Chen Tianqiao was so excited that he sometimes woke up from his dreams.

11月，盛大网络游戏《传奇》上线。这是一款陈天桥从韩国Actoz公司引进，以30万美金获得独家代理权的游戏。当时盛大所有的资金只够用来购买传奇的版权，连租服务器的钱都没有。《传奇》是一种扮演类游戏，玩家花时间、金钱投入其中，用户黏性非常强，盛大也赚得盆满钵满。一个月后，《传奇》同时在线的人数迅速突破40万，盛大的投资全部收回。2002年，盛大收入和净利润达到3.26亿元和1.39亿元；2003年收入和净利润均较上年翻了近1倍，分别达6.33亿元和2.73亿元。此时盛大的员工只有100人左右，但《传奇》每天带来的收入已经突破100万元，陈天桥兴奋地有时会从梦中惊醒。

In 2002, Blogcn was founded, marking the rise of personal portals and the entry of internet portals into the Web 2.0 era. "Blog," derived from the English term Weblog/blog, serves as a personal information exchange center on the internet. After a few years of development, blogs evolved from a small group activity into a mainstream phenomenon. They transformed from a new form of online content organization and dissemination to a personal label and reflection in the virtual world. Blogs elevated from being a tool to an expression of values. What blogs presented to the world was not just simple diaries or boring logs, but rather the essence of personal thoughts and growth.

In August, Fang Xingdong founded the predecessor of Blogcn (later known as BlogChina). Within three years, the website consistently achieved over 30% monthly growth, and its global ranking soared to over 60th place. In 2004 and 2005, it raised millions of dollars, sparking a Web 2.0 investment boom in China. Subsequently, any VC active in China at the time who was unfamiliar with terms like Blog, Podcast, RSS, or P2P, or who ignored projects like blogs, podcasts, videos, and social networking, was considered outdated.

Later, "Blog China" was rebranded as "Blog.cn," with the goal of becoming a blog-style portal, claiming to be the "world's largest Chinese blog site." However, the millions in funding were quickly squandered. This marked the beginning of a period of intense personnel upheaval at Blog.cn, with almost the entire senior management team leaving. Fang Xingdong's role as CEO was replaced by a decision-making group. By the end of 2006, Blog.cn's staff had been reduced to just over 40 people, a far cry from the number at the time of the initial investment. It was a tragic fall from being a Web 2.0 pioneer to becoming a forgotten entity.
