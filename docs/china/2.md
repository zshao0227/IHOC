# 2000–2007: Popularization and Portals – The Internet Enters Every Household

---
In the early 2000s, Chinese tech companies, especially Alibaba, lay the foundations for the pervasive urban e-commerce environment that would emerge fifteen years later. They’re waiting for one thing: scale. State control is relatively light and lags innovation, although online monitoring and censorship are already underway.

2000年代初期，中国科技公司，尤其是阿里巴巴，为15年后出现的普遍城市电子商务环境奠定了基础。他们等待的是一件事：规模。国家控制相对较轻，落后于创新，尽管在线监控和审查制度已经在进行中。

March 2000 – Bill Clinton thinks trying to crack down on the internet is like “trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.” But the internet in China develops within the context of a political regime finding mechanisms to ensure continued control—not a government sleepwalking into a digitally driven revolution.

2000 年 3 月 – 比尔·克林顿 （Bill Clinton） 认为试图打击互联网就像“试图将果冻钉在墙上”。但中国的互联网是在一个政治政权寻找确保持续控制的机制的背景下发展的，而不是一个政府梦游到一场数字驱动的革命中。

December 2000 – There are 22.5 million internet users in China.

2000 年 12 月 – 中国有 2250 万互联网用户。

>## In 2001, the China Internet Association was established, and Yao Jinbo founded Xueda and Chuangqi.
2001年，中国互联网协会成立、姚劲波创办学大、创奇。

---
In May 2001, the China Internet Association was established. This national non-profit organization, initiated by Chinese enterprises and institutions engaged in the internet industry and related sectors, marked the beginning of a new chapter in the self-management and self-service of China's internet industry.In the same year, Li Rubin, Jin Xin, and Yao Jinbo started with a tutoring agency and founded Xueda Education, becoming known as the "Three Gentlemen of Xueda." Nine years later, they successfully brought the company to the New York Stock Exchange.

2001年，5月，中国互联网协会成立。这家由中国从事互联网业及互联网相关产业的企事业单位和社会各界发起设立的全国非盈利性社会团体，标志着中国互联网的行业自我管理、自我服务揭开了新篇章。同年，李如彬、金鑫、姚劲波以家教中介起步，创立了学大教育，三人并称为“学大三君子”。9年之后，他们一起将公司送上了纽交所。

In November, SNDA's online game *mir2* was launched. This game was introduced by Chen Tianqiao, who secured exclusive distribution rights from the Korean Actoz company for \$300,000. At the time, SNDA's funds were only enough to purchase the *mir2* copyright, with no money left even for renting servers. *mir2* was a role-playing game, where players invested significant time and money, creating strong user engagement. Shengda earned substantial profits. Within a month, the number of simultaneous users of *mir2* quickly surpassed 400,000, and Shengda had recouped all its investment. In 2002, SNDA’s revenue and net profit reached 326 million yuan and 139 million yuan, respectively. In 2003, both revenue and net profit nearly doubled compared to the previous year, reaching 633 million yuan and 273 million yuan, respectively. At this time, SNDA had only about 100 employees, but *mir2* was generating over 1 million yuan in daily revenue. Chen Tianqiao was so excited that he sometimes woke up from his dreams.

11月，盛大网络游戏《传奇》上线。这是一款陈天桥从韩国Actoz公司引进，以30万美金获得独家代理权的游戏。当时盛大所有的资金只够用来购买传奇的版权，连租服务器的钱都没有。《传奇》是一种扮演类游戏，玩家花时间、金钱投入其中，用户黏性非常强，盛大也赚得盆满钵满。一个月后，《传奇》同时在线的人数迅速突破40万，盛大的投资全部收回。2002年，盛大收入和净利润达到3.26亿元和1.39亿元；2003年收入和净利润均较上年翻了近1倍，分别达6.33亿元和2.73亿元。此时盛大的员工只有100人左右，但《传奇》每天带来的收入已经突破100万元，陈天桥兴奋地有时会从梦中惊醒。

>## In 2002, Blogcn was founded, marking the rise of personal portals and the entry of internet portals into the Web 2.0 era.
2002年，博客网成立，个人门户兴起，互联网门户进入2.0时代。

---
In August 2002, Fang Xingdong founded the predecessor of Blogcn (later known as BlogChina). Within three years, the website consistently achieved over 30% monthly growth, and its global ranking soared to over 60th place. In 2004 and 2005, it raised millions of dollars, sparking a Web 2.0 investment boom in China. Subsequently, any VC active in China at the time who was unfamiliar with terms like Blog, Podcast, RSS, or P2P, or who ignored projects like blogs, podcasts, videos, and social networking, was considered outdated.Later, "Blog China" was rebranded as "Blog.cn," with the goal of becoming a blog-style portal, claiming to be the "world's largest Chinese blog site." However, the millions in funding were quickly squandered. This marked the beginning of a period of intense personnel upheaval at Blog.cn, with almost the entire senior management team leaving. Fang Xingdong's role as CEO was replaced by a decision-making group. By the end of 2006, Blog.cn's staff had been reduced to just over 40 people, a far cry from the number at the time of the initial investment. It was a tragic fall from being a Web 2.0 pioneer to becoming a forgotten entity.

2002年8月，方兴东创建博客网的前身(博客中国)，之后3年内网站始终保持每月超过30%的增长，全球排名一度飙升到60多位。并于2004年、2005年融资千万美元，并引发了中国Web2.0的投资热潮。其后活跃在中国的VC要是不知道Blog、Podcast、RSS、P2P等术语，不看博客、播客、视频、交友等项目就是落伍的标志。历史只不过在换一种方式重演，昨天的web2.0，今天的web3.0，明天的web4.0。风吹网面，雁过长空。随后，“博客中国”更名为“博客网”，并宣称要做博客式门户，号称“全球最大中文博客网站”，而后千万美元很快就被挥霍殆尽。博客网至此拉开了持续3年的人事剧烈动荡，高层几乎整体流失，而方兴东本人的CEO职务也被一个决策小组取代。到2006年年底，博客网的员工已经缩减恢复到融资当初的40多个人。从引领Web2.0的先驱成为无人问津的弃儿，可惜至极。

By 2020, the number of online game users in China had reached 518 million, with mobile game users totaling 516 million, and the market size had grown to 278.69 billion RMB.

2002年底，我国网络游戏用户数已达807.4万，其中付费用户达401.3万，占到了总数的约50％。网络游戏市场规模达到9.1亿元人民币。到2020年，我国网络游戏用户规模达到5.18亿人，移动游戏用户规模为5.16亿人，市场规模达到2786.9亿元。

In the late 2000s, China’s online censorship apparatus becomes more sophisticated. Censors suppress search results, block entire websites or specific pages within them, or give users a “connection reset” error when a restricted keyword appears in a URL.

2000 年代后期，中国的网络审查机构变得更加复杂。审查者会抑制搜索结果，阻止整个网站或其中的特定页面，或者在 URL 中出现受限关键字时给用户带来“连接重置”错误。

---
At the same time, patriotic fervor around the Olympics and related controversies in 2008, as well as a thriving culture of euphemisms and ironic references, signal the explosion of China’s digital public sphere. It appears that, just maybe, the scale and dynamism of the internet could prove too hard for the government to control.

与此同时，围绕 2008 年奥运会和相关争议的爱国热情，以及委婉语和讽刺语的蓬勃发展，标志着中国数字公共领域的爆炸式增长。看来，也许互联网的规模和活力对政府来说可能太难控制了。

In December 2006, a computer worm virus named "Worm.WhBoy.cw" infected millions of computers. All ".exe" executable files in the infected systems were changed to resemble a panda holding incense. Subsequently, more than 30 variants of this virus emerged, severely threatening the security of internet users' systems and creating a strong demand for antivirus solutions. In 2007, the creators and major distributors of the "Worm.WhBoy.cw" virus, including Li Jun, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to four years for damaging computer information systems. In 2014, Zhang Shun and Li Jun were sentenced to five and three years in prison, respectively, for operating a gambling business and fined 200,000 yuan and 80,000 yuan, respectively.
