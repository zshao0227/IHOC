Back in the 1990s, both Chinese officials concerned about retaining control and American observers hoping for liberalization believed that the internet would change China. Now that the fourth and fifth eras of China’s internet development have cultivated a largely separate online ecosystem, the question becomes whether China will change the rest of the world.  
早在 1990 年代，担心保留控制权的中国官员和希望自由化的美国观察家都认为互联网会改变中国。现在，中国互联网发展的第四和第五个时代已经培育出一个基本上独立的在线生态系统，问题就变成了中国是否会改变世界其他地区 。

Efforts by Chinese companies to sell their technology overseas mean that products designed for China’s authoritarian context could form the backbone of connectivity in a wide range of societies. Assuming that China’s politics will travel with its machines, however, is a lot like assuming that US democracy would travel with the internet. Beware of confident predictions.  
中国公司努力向海外销售其技术，这意味着为中国专制环境设计的产品可以成为广泛社会互联互通的支柱。然而，假设中国的政治将与机器一起传播，这很像假设美国的民主将与互联网一起传播。谨防自信的预测。

The coming years will present a profusion of automated and autonomous technologies, the deep integration of networks into physical space, and profound challenges surrounding privacy and accountability.
